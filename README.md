# Multithreaded-Http-Server
Server is programmed in Java. It is a simple server similar to HTTP 0.9 but it also sends a OK (Code 200) response so you can test it in Google Chrome or any modern browser.

Note that it supports only **GET Requests** to .html or .jpg files. 

A thread that logs the requests is also included in the code called **RequestLogger**

Server can be extended to handle other types of requests and support more HTTP responses in the future.

 How to Run
------
* Clone the project.
* Run the code in your favorite Java IDE.
* Enter a **TCP** Port number for server.
* Write the directory path from which the files are going to be served.
* Have fun :)
